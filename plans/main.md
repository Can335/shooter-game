# Plans

Everything we have to do and all plans for the project.

- [ ] [FP system](fp-system/main.md)

Notes for FP System
 
 Shooting:
  
Damage when hitting depends on the magnitude and the velocity and ammonution and body part it hits of the body

- [ ] Depends on the action mode
  Bolt-Action
Revolvers
Lever-Action
Pump-Action (Slide-Action)
Break-Action (Hinge)
Semi-Automatic (Autoloading)
Full-Automatic

The guns mostly used are Semi-automatic and Full automatic and single shots (correct some of this im not good at guns)

full auto --> hold m1
semi --> click once lets go 3 rounds
single --> click once lets go 1 round

every gun has an rpm so the rpm/60 will be the cooldown
