Notes:
Notes for FP System
 
 Shooting:
  
Damage when hitting depends on the magnitude and the velocity and ammonution and body part it hits of the body

- [ ] Depends on the action mode
  Bolt-Action
Revolvers
Lever-Action
Pump-Action (Slide-Action)
Break-Action (Hinge)
Semi-Automatic (Autoloading)
Full-Automatic

The guns mostly used are Semi-automatic and Full automatic and single shots (correct some of this im not good at guns)

full auto --> hold m1
semi --> click once lets go 3 rounds
single --> click once lets go 1 round




every gun has an rpm so the rpm/60 will be the cooldown

Aiming:

-Left click hold to aim
-Lets go once you let go 

-Click Q To aim
-Click Q again To release aim

-Crosshair dissapears when aiming
-Crosshair appears when stopping to aim

-The Bullet still comes out of the barrel instead of shooting out of the projectile aim (obviously)

Reloading:

-Click R to Reload

-Cannot reload when mag is full

-reloading causes the last mag to go means if you reload at lets say 15 the 15 ammo goes and you go to the next mag

-Disable sprinting while reloading + disabling shooting and some features and increasing the size of the crosshair , because when u reload you dont have good aim.

-There will not be an whole ammo count like 332 but rather counting in mags so 30 , 30 ,30 resulting you have 3 mags making it more realistic


-eqqupping/unequipping

To switch guns you either press 1,2,3,4,5 keys 

by default you have ur hands eqquipped

pressing the same key twice so:

1 eqquping
1 again uneqquiping and eqquiping hands

crosshair will also spring in size a little when the eqquping animation plays
